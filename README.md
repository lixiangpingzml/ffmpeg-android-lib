FFmpeg README
=============
增加h.264格式的编解码库 ，库的源码和编译条件参考 https://github.com/lixiangpingzml/x264/tree/master

建议在ubuntu 14环境下面编译，我在windows下面编译，会有很多环境设置和路径配置通不过。
在build_android.sh脚本，配置好ndk环境路径，链接h.264的库和头文件，执行脚本，就会生成我们在android平台使用的动态so库

FFmpeg is a collection of libraries and tools to process multimedia content
such as audio, video, subtitles and related metadata.

## Libraries

* `libavcodec` provides implementation of a wider range of codecs.
* `libavformat` implements streaming protocols, container formats and basic I/O access.
* `libavutil` includes hashers, decompressors and miscellaneous utility functions.
* `libavfilter` provides a mean to alter decoded Audio and Video through chain of filters.
* `libavdevice` provides an abstraction to access capture and playback devices.
* `libswresample` implements audio mixing and resampling routines.
* `libswscale` implements color conversion and scaling routines.

## Tools

* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) is a command line toolbox to
  manipulate, convert and stream multimedia content.
* [ffplay](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html) is a minimalistic multimedia player.
* [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) is a simple analysis tool to inspect
  multimedia content.
* [ffserver](https://ffmpeg.org/ffserver.html) is a multimedia streaming server
  for live broadcasts.
* Additional small tools such as `aviocat`, `ismindex` and `qt-faststart`.
